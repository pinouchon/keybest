# keybest

Implementation for MAC and Ubuntu(XKB) of the QGMLWY layout described here: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization

I currently use the mac version. Source here: https://github.com/pinouchon/keybest/blob/master/rewrite_c/alterkeys.c
On Ubuntu, the mapping is done through XKB, source here: https://github.com/pinouchon/keybest/blob/master/xkb/symbols/keybest
